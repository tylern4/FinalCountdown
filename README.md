#The Final Countdown

A simple C++ program to give a colored countdown in the command line.

I built this because I often want to wait for one command to finish before running a new command in
another window (when I didn't think ahead and jsut && it in the first place).

##Build
Building is simple 
* `make`
* `./countdown`

I've also moved the script into my path by:

* `sudo cp countdown /usr/local/bin/`
